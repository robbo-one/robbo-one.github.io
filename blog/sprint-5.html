    <h1>
        The end of the beggining - sprint - 5
    </h1>
    <p>
        The following are reflection questions from the end of foundations Sprint 5.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>


    <p> 
        One thing that I've learnt is that the growth mindset is a useful reminder when you are stuck on something, those are often the moments when we learn the most.
        To be patient everything isn't going to click right away.
        that it's impossible to remember everything, google is your friend + slack. It's never as bad as you think usually, for instance if you feel really stuck when
         you finally figure it out or get someone to show you then it's often sooooo much simpler than you can imagine. our minds tend to overcomplicate things somtimes when learning a subject like this.
    </p>
           <h2>
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h2>
            
            <p> 
                Self awareness is super important so you have structure to your learning and stay healthy during the process.
                empathy is important to be able to understand how people around you may be feeling and to act in a compassionate way.
                values are some of the things that define us and having healthy values is very important.
          </p>

        <h2>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>

     <p>
        That it's a great attribute to the learning process, it's a pleasant suprise that EDA isn't just focused on non stop lectures, cramming info and exams and repeat.
    </p>


        <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2> 

        <p>
            Some of the questions when you really have to think about yourself, a lot of those 
            questions aren't things we would often ask ourselves all the time.
        </p>


        
        <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
             just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        
         <p> 
              I don't think so, sometimes it is a welcome break from coding if you have been
              going at it for hours. I think it definitely has it's benefits in understanding
              more about ourselves along side the learning process. As well as providing structure 
              and more understanding of the most effective ways to learn.  Whilst looking after
             ourselves at the same time and performing in a way that is most effective for us and those around us.
