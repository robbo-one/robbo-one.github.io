    <h1>Learning plan - Dev Academy</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>My Long Term goal and career pathway so far is to gain as much knowledge
         as I can, and grow through these challenges. I hope to find enjoyment
          from working in this industry and figuring out what parts I like doing
           the most and exploring the huge array of pathways that coding can lead
            to. I also would like to use my skills to launch my own websites and
             apps perhaps for entrepreneurial  ideas I have. As well as  be able
              to collaborate with friends and artists and help to promote their
               craft and expression through the methods I learn. There are a lot
                of unhealthy things about tech, but also some incredibly good 
                things as well  that have reshaped the world we live in.
                 I hope to be involved in projects that make a difference
                  for people and the environment, things that make a positive
                   impact in the world.</p>
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA? </h2>
    <p>’d like to become as effiecient as possible in the learning
         process and hone these skills
         and tactics so that I can transfer them to anything I am
          learning in the future. I look forward to making connections
           with other students and seeing what collaborations this could
            lead to in the future. Gaining more confidence as I go would
             be great also and suprising myself with the results I can achieve,
              giving me even more motivation to succeed.</p>
    <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I should take more breaks, if I feel like i’m in that ‘flow state’
         whilst working on something I just go all out and don’t stop as often as I
          probably should. So I think being kinder to myself and taking regular breaks
           more often and using the timer to help with that. Sometimes I can be a bit
            harsh on myself and get too focused on something that didn’t come out right
             first time, I forget to celebrate how far I’ve come and what I have gained
              so far. So remembering to celebrate those achievements and not totally focus
               on the improvement areas, as important as they are!</p>
    <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
         This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
    <p>I will make good  use of structure and daily journal plans at the 
        start and end of every day. Breaking up the day more and using the
         timer and taking a break not just reset it and carry on for hours.
          Keeping in good contact with my facilitator and other fellow students,
           asking for feedback and helping each other learn. Keeping up a healthy
            lifestyle, eating well, excersising and time outside away from the screen!</p>
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
    <p>If I get stuck I’ll reach out to google and youtube first, then my cohort on Slack and my course
         faciitator If I’m still having trouble. As well as talking to family and friends,it aint weak to speak! 
         It's all good having a healthy mind or a healthy body but if you don't have both then It's like not having
          fuel in your car, things won't go smooth<a href="https://livin.org/" alt="link to livin.org website">livin.org</a></p>
    
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
    <p>Good contact and easy to talk to, there to help if you are stuck.
         Checking regularly that you are on track. I’d love to get as much feedback
          as possible of things I can improve on,
          I want to make the most out of my time at EDA. 
          Generally just a friendly point of call. </p>
          <h2>Is there any scheduling information such as block-out times required?</h2>
          <p>I will definitely need some time for moving up in time for Bootcamp. 
              When I know where I will be staying I can plan the days I’ll do this. 
              Hopefully in the gap between Foundations and Bootcamp will
            work out to be the perfect time.</p>

            <h3>PEACE</h3>
