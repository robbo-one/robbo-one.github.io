    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?
    </h2>
    <p>Understanding that the sky is the limit when it comes to learning
         is more important than we ever thought. Knowing that growth
          in our abilities  is possible for everyone is so important.
           Being trapped in a mindset where you don’t realise that you
            can learn anything is damaging. That mindest doesn’t allow
             growth and isn’t very positive. We are born Knowing
              nothing we learn everything and can learn anything, 
              it’s important to know this. We aren’t already born with 
              the skills we posess. Our brains can change completely depending
               what tasks we are focusing on. The more we focus and practice
                something the more our brains will adapt pathways and store
                 knowledge related to those subjects. Our brains are mouldable
                  like putty.</p>

                  <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of
                       neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h2>

            <p>When facing any challenge or learning process it’s valuable 
                to remember that this is part of the process. The difficult
                 parts are often the most important, This is when we grow, this
                  is when our brains are changing, neurons are firing and building
                   new pathways all the time. If we stop doing something for a 
                   while the brain starts to make less of a pathway towards those 
                   things because it thinks that we don’t need that information so
                    much anymore. It's important to remember when learning something that
                     may seem challenging that this is key to reaching your
                      optimum level of learning and updating the pathways in the brain. The challenges
                       are where we grow and discover new understandings of a topic or skill
                       No matter your age or where you are from it doesn’t matter our 
                       brains constantly change and we are responsible for what we feed it.</p>

                       <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity.</h2>

        <p>If you do certain things more often or dedicate more time to 
            them then the brain will strengthen it’s connections in regards
             to those activities. This is involved whenever we are learning
              but also can be crucial in carving out habits that we have, 
              good or bad. If we keep doing something it’s more likely we 
              are going to keep doing it and the more we do it the better we
               will get! <img src= "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/02/18/17/mechanical-2033446_1280.jpg" alt="brain picture"></p>

        <h2>Growth Mindset - what it is and why it is relevant?</h2>
        <p>It is extremely relevant as having the opposite mindset of thinking
             that we are not good at something or unable to improve in something
              is shooting ourselves down immediately. It can puts the breaks on 
              the learning process before you even start. Many people believe they
               are born with a mindset that cannot be changed after childhood and that learning new
                things is very difficult beyond the younger ages. This is however not true as well as not being a useful
                 mindset that will benefit the learning process and growth of our minds!
                 We need to realise that having a mindset where we know we can grow in any 
                 subject we turn our focus and attention can have incredible results
                  on our learning abilities. The sky really is the limit here!</p>

                  <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                  <p>Having looked at this subject before nothing was a huge surprise, 
                      however! It is always good to be reminded of the benefits of this often and 
                      give yourself a boost, especially if you are struggling with something 
                      you are learning. The growth mindset is so important for learning to code!
