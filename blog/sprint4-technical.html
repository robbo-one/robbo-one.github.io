    <h1>Problem solving</h1>
    <h2> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
 Got blocked on a simple problem & solved a problem in an elegant way.</h2>

<p>The problem was the Fizz Buzz challenge. you need to write a function that
     takes an array of numbers. Then once the function is run it should
      return that array of numbers.
    But for every number that is a multiple of 3 return "Fizz" 
    instead of that number. For every number that is a multiple of 5, 
    return "Buzz" instead of that number.
    For every number divisible by 3 & 5 return "Fizzbuzz" instead of the number.
     If none of those rules are applicable to the number in the array then it just 
     returns the number.
    For example the returned array should be someting like
     1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizzbuzz ...
      and so on.</p>
    <p>In one part of coding the Fizz Buzz / SuperFizzBuzz Kata challenge I started
     my line of code for the function with a 
    line that saved writing it out a slightly longer way without really realising
     until it was pointed out. I used 15 instead of a statement mentioning 3 && 5 
     for the Fizzbuzz rule. I found the challenge very difficult, although I could
      make total sense of it in my head. being able to write it as a working function
      was certainly a challenge!</p>
      <p>I have learnt that there are so many ways you can code something and achieve
       the same result. However there are some that are far more efficient and take up a
       lot less time! I also learnt that I need to practice this one more and really understand it
       although I got it to pass I still was confused. PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE.</p>

       <p>One simple problem I got blocked on for a while was a function of mine wouldn't
        pass. Prior to writing the function ruleset I just wanted to pass it as a 
        correctly coded function.
        I had written it out correctly and even a friend had tested it and it was working.
        I was stumped. but then was informed of a missing curly bracket. so bascially It was
         incorporating all of the above code in the function which rendered it uselesss.
         I used console to check this and reached out on slack for a second pair of eyes.
         This was greatly helpful and it was yet another reminder that very often an error can 
         be down to an incorrect use or missing syntax.</p>

<h2>Reflections on  using problem solving techniques and process:</h2>


<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<p>pseudocode can be super helpful, and it's a welcome break from looking at
a blank block in the code and not even knowing where to start. Some problems
 or errors contain many elements in which the only way to solve it is to break
  them down one by one. Writing it in pseudocode helps see it in plain english
   and then you can work on finding the right code method to solve the issue,
hopefully without too much stress!</p>

<h2>Trying something</h2>
<p>some of the problems make total sense when you read through them but then
     you can get totally stumped on how to code it. giving it a go even in these
      situations can be much more helpful than it seems at the time. I'll always give it a go,
       this certainly doesn't mean I will get it though!</p>

<h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
<p> Sadly I do not have a rubber duck, but I did explain a method to a family
     member which I was finding difficult to code and it reinforced the 
     learning around that problem. A great way to learn is to teach what you are
      trying to figure out. Or tell someone
      or a rubber duck about the code</p>

<h2>Reading error messages</h2>
<p>I feel reasonably confident in figuring out error messages, but sometimes 
    another
     method is then needed to figure out how to input what is required</p>
<h2>Console.logging</h2>
<p>I feel pretty confident in console.logging it can help test a function you have
     written and see what comes back.</p>

<h2>Googling</h2>
<p>Google is great! it can sometimes be a blessing and a curse as you may
     be given so many results and none of them are exactly what you are 
     looking for. 
    but with a bit of searching and keyword refinement it can be super
     helpful! along with youtube to actually see someone doing it and
      breaking it down at the same time
</p>
<h2>Asking peers for help</h2>
<p>I have certainly been reaching out on slack when I feel completely stuck and 
    google can't save me.
    I would say this is the most useful method for rpoblem solving if you are 
    really stuck. sometimes someone spotting something you missed or explaining
     it in a different way helps it to click for you! Shout out to Ben!
</p>
<h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
<p>Up until the Kata challenges I have managed fine, the first ones were fine but
     from FizzBuzz onwards I need to do some more breaking down of what's going
      on and how to code it correctly.
     There are definitely some things I want to break down with my
      facilitator to ensure I understand
      them completely.</p>

<h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
<p>I think reflection is very helpful and it helps to break it all down in words 
    to make sure you still understand something you have been going over I am going
     to create a list of some things I wish to dive into more in order to fully 
     understand them.</p>
