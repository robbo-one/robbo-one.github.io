        <h2>Preparing for Bootcamp</h2>


        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

        <p>
            I would like to use the skills I obtain during the course
             to enable me to enter into a role as a full stack developer,
              learning as much as I possibly can. I want to eventually
               launch my own buisiness ideas using these skills and further skills that
               I will learn whilst working as developer. I hope to be able to 
               work on projects that are causes for good.
         </p>

         <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

         <p>
            My biggest strengths at bootcamp will be the desire to learn
             as much as possible with the added  help of what I have 
             already learned during foundations. The determination to
              suceed and push through when tackling tricky tasks.
               I don’t see any limitations, I know it’s going to be tough and  
               overwhelming at times but I have the drive to
                push through and the desire to learn as much as possible.
         </p>

         <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

         <p>
            The biggest non technical challenges will be spending lots of time indoors studying during summer.
         </p>

         <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to
              see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>

              <p>
                  Confidence in all of the new skills I'm learning. 
                  Not to feel bad for reaching out when I’m stuck on something,
                   this is expected and part of the process. Rome wasn’t built
                    in a day.
              </p>

              <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

              <p>
                I expect to give it my best shot and to be kind to myself during the tough parts.
                I imagine it is going to be full on, with tons to learn
                 and put into practice. With long hours and many new problems  and challenges 
                 to solve.
                  I’ll seek help if I need it through peers,
                   staff and/or my course facilitator if I should need to do so. 
              </p>

              <h3>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>

              <p>
                I will limit distractions and allocate my time as a priority 
                to learning and working through bootcamp as best I possibly can.
                 I will plan my days and keep a record and reflections of what
                  I am learing and working through. As well as taking time out to 
                  staying healthy and well rested so I can perform at my optimum.
              </p>
